# Intro_2_Programming-Algorithm_CELEN046

This repo contains several exercises implemented in Octave.

This is the Year-1 coursework of intro to programming and algorithm.

All the questions are solved independently.

The repo is used to manage my CW code only. 

I am not sure whether I am allowed to put the CW questions here. If not, please contact me.
